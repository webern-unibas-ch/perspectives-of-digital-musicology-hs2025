# Assignment 7

- Write a one-page essay reflecting on the opportunities and challenges that digital methods and tools, including AI, bring to musicology. Consider how these tools might change what it means to study, document, analyze, create, or experience music. Support your viewpoint with at least one concrete example (from research, educational contexts, or creative practice).

- Optional: You may use an AI writing assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, Copilot) for part or all of your draft, but if you do, reflect on how this changed your writing process, your personal engagement, and your sense of authorship. Also include a brief end note describing (a) specifically which AI tool and how it was used (including prompts) and (b) your personal response to the process.

- Deadline: Wednesday evening, send per Mail to Stefan Münnich
