# Assignment 8

- Write a one-page **response essay** to the essay you read and discussed today. Engage critically but constructively with the key themes raised by the authors. Try to extend, challenge, or complicate the original argument with your own perspectives. In general, try to express not just agreement/disagreement, but to create dialogue, extension, critique, alternative perspectives, or deeper exploration of themes raised in the original essay. You can find orientation by the questions used in the session of [week 9](../weeks/week-09.md).

- Optional: You may use an AI writing assistant (e.g., ChatGPT, Perplexity.ai, Copilot) for part or all of your draft, but if you do, reflect on how this changed your writing process, your personal engagement, and your sense of authorship. Also include a brief end note describing (a) specifically which AI tool and how it was used (including prompts) and (b) your personal response to the process.

- **Deadline: Wednesday evening, send per E-Mail to Stefan Münnich**
