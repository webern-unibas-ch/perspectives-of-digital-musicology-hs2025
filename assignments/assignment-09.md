# Assignment 9

**Mini Digital ESC Project (Slide Deck)**

Design a mini (fake) research project that uses digital and/or AI tools to study some aspect of the Eurovision Song Contest. Present it next week in a short slide deck of 4-6 slides (5-minute presentation). 

This assignment is about *designing* a research project, not implementing it; focus on making your question clear and your methodological choices thoughtful and well‑justified.

Example outline: 

- Slide 1 – Research Question

  - Formulate one clear question that really benefits from digital methods (examples: questions related to musical features, "bloc voting", lyrics topics, etc.)

- Slide 2 – Data

  - Briefly answer what data you would need (rankings, audio features, lyrics, tweets, etc.)? Where could that data come from (ESC datasets, APIs, websites, existing research, field studies etc.)?

- Slide 3 – Digital Methods

  - State which tools or methods you would use and for what? E.g. audio feature analysis, MIR, music encoding, sentiment analysis, generative AI for clustering/summarizing. For each, say what goes in (input) and what you hope to get out (output).

- Slide 4 – Interpretation & Limitations

    - How would you interpret the results? What musicological or cultural insights do you hope for? Where is human/musicological judgement and expertise still essential?

- Final slides - Limitations/Risks
   
   - Name at least two limitations or risks (e.g. biased or incomplete data, opaque features, over‑interpretation, ethics of social media data or AI use) related to your project outline. Optionally: How you would mitigate one of these risks in your project design?


**Deadline: Wednesday evening, send slides as PDF or PPT per E-Mail to Stefan Münnich**
