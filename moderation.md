# Moderation Guidelines

## Setting Ground Rules

- listening respectfully, speaking one at a time, and encouraging criticism of ideas rather than individuals

## Structuring the Discussion

- Begin with open-ended, focused questions related to the paper to prompt conversation and deeper analysis.
- Prepare a few backup questions if the group grows silent or stuck.

- Invite other students to share their thoughts, possibly by giving everyone time to write down their opinions before speaking.
- Be aware of non-verbal cues and offer encouragement to students who may want to contribute.

- Paraphrase or summarize key points as they emerge and ask for clarifications if needed.
- Invite final comments to ensure everyone feels heard and the discussion feels complete.
